# WEEK 05

## Research

Contextualisation <br/>
— Animal skins were worn as clothing can be traced back to as early as after the 2nd Ice Age. Fabrics were developed from this <br/>
— Tapestries were originally made to tell stories (typically the stories of royalty or wealthy patrons) + as a form of decoration <br/>
— They are extremely time consuming to produce (maybe I can use this in the final work somehow) <br/>
— Oldest surviving European tapestries are the viking Överhogdal tapestries dated between 800 - 1170AD <br/>
 <br/>
Primary concepts <br/>
— Making art is an inherently human thing <br/>
— Tapestry is used to tell stories, to educate and to entertain <br/>
— Our input is the world, our output is the artwork; this is evident from the earliest forms of human creativity <br/>
— Tapestry has a physicality to it, a tactile nature, it is bound and woven to be strong. What if we took that way..? <br/>
— Is it still art if a computer makes it? <br/>
— How do current and future works inform the works of the past?  <br/>
 <br/>
Secondary concepts <br/>
— Decay and how that translates into the digital; known as ‘digital decay’ or ‘data rot’ <br/>
— Visual artefacts present in compressed images. ‘Deep frying’ an image <br/>
— Lost in translation comes to mind, as the more we filter digital images the more information they lose. What you’re left with can be highly distorted and glitchy. I want to potentially combine these digitally decayed images with an effect which mimics the real life decay of fabric and other natural materials <br/>

### What is the overall idea?  <br/>
The idea is to create an algorithm which procedurally generates tapestries within a set of parameters
