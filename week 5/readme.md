# WEEK 05

## Research

**Contextualisation**
— Animal skins were worn as clothing can be traced back to as early as after the 2nd Ice Age. Fabrics were developed from this <br/>
— Tapestries were originally made to tell stories (typically the stories of royalty or wealthy patrons) + as a form of decoration <br/>
— They are extremely time consuming to produce (maybe I can use this in the final work somehow) <br/>
— Oldest surviving European tapestries are the viking Överhogdal tapestries dated between 800 - 1170AD <br/>
 <br/>
**Primary concepts**
— Making art is an inherently human thing <br/>
— Tapestry is used to tell stories, to educate and to entertain <br/>
— Our input is the world, our output is the artwork; this is evident from the earliest forms of human creativity <br/>
— Tapestry has a physicality to it, a tactile nature, it is bound and woven to be strong. What if we took that way..? <br/>
— Is it still art if a computer makes it? <br/>
— How do current and future works inform the works of the past?  <br/>
 <br/>
**Secondary concepts**
— Decay and how that translates into the digital; known as ‘digital decay’ or ‘data rot’ <br/>
— Visual artefacts present in compressed images. ‘Deep frying’ an image <br/>
— Lost in translation comes to mind, as the more we filter digital images the more information they lose. What you’re left with can be highly distorted and glitchy. I want to potentially combine these digitally decayed images with an effect which mimics the real life decay of fabric and other natural materials <br/>

### The idea: What?
**What is the overall idea?**
The idea is to create an algorithm which procedurally generates tapestries within a set of parameters <br/>
**Summary & Concept:**
To look at the concept of objects as artefacts and to see how the future can inform, reinterpret, and re-shape the past. To challenge the idea of free-will and pre-determinism, and to find out whether artistic creativity is strictly reserved for human beings. <br/>
### Research Basis: Why?
**Igniting Ideas:**
The idea to work with tapestries has been floating around in my mind for years, it stems from my fascination with ancient history and the interconnected pasts we all share. I like the concept of relics and artefacts, all objects are inherently artefacts, all you need to do is wait long enough.  <br/>
**Observations?**
One observation while researching tapestries is that this artform is alive and well, artists continuing on the tradition, while also pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible. <br/>
**What is the work saying?** 
The work would challenge the idea of who or what can be ‘the maker’ or ‘the artist’. It may suggest that computers and algorithms could perhaps be seen as programmable primordial life forms, who live in a predetermined existence. And when using this framework; are we as humans any different?  <br/>
**Why?**
Fabric is like an analogue pixel matrix. Tapestry is an ancient artform; the tools we use to create it may have changed, but the act of time consumingly weaving something into being has remained the same. This work would challenge the idea of who or what can be ‘the maker’ or ‘the artist’. And in doing so it might alter the way we look at tapestries from the past. <br/> 
### The System: How?
**What will the system need to do?** 
The system will need to procedurally generate something which resembles a rug or tapestry. This can be abstract in nature, and experimental visuals are highly encouraged.  <br/>
**What are the parameters of control?** 
The parameters will include the size of the tapestry, the colour palettes it will sample from, the rate at which the tapestry is woven, and what kind of imagery it will produce.  <br/>
**How are the parameters influenced by the objectives?** 
The parameters will be random allowing for an endless amount of outcomes. This could in some way be tied into the concept of human creativity. Though each artwork we create may seem like a unique and individual response; perhaps we are simply drawing/summoning into reality one of the endless outcomes that already exists in the ether. Our own human algorithm working within universal parameters.  <br/>
**What are the parameters based on? & comments of the conceptual basis?** The parameters are based on randomness.  <br/>
**Inputs & Outputs:** Inputs include a number of random elements which will generate the tapestry, they will  <br/>
