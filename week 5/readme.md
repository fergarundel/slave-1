# WEEK 05

## Research

Contextualisation
— Animal skins were worn as clothing can be traced back to as early as after the 2nd Ice Age. Fabrics were developed from this
— Tapestries were originally made to tell stories (typically the stories of royalty or wealthy patrons) + as a form of decoration
— They are extremely time consuming to produce (maybe I can use this in the final work somehow)
— Oldest surviving European tapestries are the viking Överhogdal tapestries dated between 800 - 1170AD

Primary concepts
— Making art is an inherently human thing
— Tapestry is used to tell stories, to educate and to entertain
— Our input is the world, our output is the artwork; this is evident from the earliest forms of human creativity
— Tapestry has a physicality to it, a tactile nature, it is bound and woven to be strong. What if we took that way..?
— Is it still art if a computer makes it?
— How do current and future works inform the works of the past? 

Secondary concepts
— Decay and how that translates into the digital; known as ‘digital decay’ or ‘data rot’
— Visual artefacts present in compressed images. ‘Deep frying’ an image
— Lost in translation comes to mind, as the more we filter digital images the more information they lose. What you’re left with can be highly distorted and glitchy. I want to potentially combine these digitally decayed images with an effect which mimics the real life decay of fabric and other natural materials
