# WEEK 04

## Research & Brain storming
I've begun thinking about which concepts I could potentially explore for my proposal. Currently there are a handful of ideas which have potential:

<br/>

— Type that reacts to movement, via a webcam or something similar

— A poster generator, something that you can feed things into and it will turn it into a poster, this would have changeable parameters (maybe computer vision?)

— Type that is responsive to ANY input that relates to some kind of yet undetermined theme

— A colour interpreter (something that has a webcam input, and mixes up the colours and values and then re-applies them to any given shape eg. a vector or something

— 3D scanning objects and using those in some generative way

— DE-generative design, making an algorithm that mimics decay and wear. Can be used on 3D models and scans of artefacts

— An automated tapestry weaver/decayer. Randomness but within certain parameters so that it creates some random elements but some that are a little more organised

<br/>

I've done some research into variable typeface design and I'm very interested in it, but I'm leaning towards the idea of the automated tapestry weaver. I think the act of weaving is an ancient and distinctly human activity; making a machine weave something raises many interesting questions. Through my research I have come across the work of [Phillip Stearns](https://phillipstearns.wordpress.com/fragmented-memory/). He's an artist who has completed a series of large scale woven tapestries using visualised binary data sourced from his hard drives. This work is a different take to what I have planned, since the tapestry would consist of things that are procedurally generated, and they would be digitally woven.

His work explores the concept of physical memory and how "The assemblage of data in a computer’s physical memory serves as a record of human activity and agency, however abstracted and fragmented".
