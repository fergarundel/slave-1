# WEEK 04

## Research
I've begun thinking about which concepts I could potentially explore for my proposal. Currently there are a handful of ideas which have potential:

<br/>

— Type that reacts to movement, via a webcam or something similar

— A poster generator, something that you can feed things into and it will turn it into a poster, this would have changeable parameters

— Type that is responsive to ANY input that relates to some kind of yet undetermined theme

— A colour interpreter (something that has a webcam input, and mixes up the colours and values and then re-applies them to any given shape eg. a vector or something

— 3D scanning objects and using those in some generative way

— DE-generative design, making an algorithm that mimics decay and wear. Can be used on 3D models and scans of artefacts

—An automated tapestry weaver/decayer. Randomness but within certain parameters so that it creates some random elements but some that are a little more organised.
