# WEEK_02


## Thoughts and inspirations

This week has been a little slower than expected. I haven't researched many generative designers, howerver I have been thinking about typography and how to link forms of data to a letterform. Responsive to the world around it. Which factors could I use, which factors would make the most sense for type? I'm sure there is a way to introduce variables into a font program. I'll have to find some programs first... One of many possible ideas is that I could make a poster which responds in some way; perhaps what the webcam sees eg. movements, light + dark, sound. This makes me think of that type of art where images are made from tiny letters and glyphs.


## Class Activity

Here are some Processing experiments, one which I found quite visually striking (the pink face is a remix of Louis' work). I've been watching a bunch of 'The Coding Train' to gain more insight; there's so much to learn!
